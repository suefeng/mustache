	{"title": "Emotional Design Part II Chapter 5 and Epilogue","body": "While I was reading chapters 5 and 6, I looked ahead to the other chapters. Chapters 6 and 7 seem to all be about robots and emotions. I didn't really want to read about robots having emotions since it didn't have much to do with emotional design in terms of products outside of the robots realm. Say what? Yeah I decided not to read the rest of the book because it's about robots. Sorry Stephanie, I know you like robots. Maybe you would be interested in reading the book. Chapters 6 and 7 are about robots. I did decide to [...]","date":"Tuesday, April 2nd, 2013"},
	{"title": "Emotional Design Part II Ch 3 & 4","body": "Instead of writing an outline similar to what I did for the first part of the book, I'm going to mention the key points that I liked about this book. That way it's less of a note taking experience and more of a review like experience. So far it's been a fun read. Part II – Design in Practice Chapters 3 and 4 Here is an image of a tea strainer from the book. It was made by Alessi, and it's called Stefano Pirovano's Te ò tea strainer.  It's cute and pleasurable, but is it fun to use? Scroll down to [...]","date":"Tuesday, April 2nd, 2013"},

	{"title": "Better Commenting Hopefully","body": "Time for a geeky rant about the commenting system on my blog! As it turns out, Commentator Comments had a bug that didn't allow users to type the < symbol in <3. When that symbol was typed, the comment is truncated at the < symbol, since you can't have an open < without an end tag > in HTML. I found out the strip_tags function was used and it didn't allow for it. I had to create two special cases to include <3 and :< as allowable symbols. But that's not very reliable, since what if someone types something that [...]","date":"Tuesday, April 1st, 2013"},
	{"title": "Emotional Design by Donald A. Norman", "body": "I'm reading Emotional Design: Why We Love (or Hate) Everyday Things, a book by Donald A. Norman. I've been reading it for quite a while now, but have not gotten past the first chapter after reading the prologue every time I pick up the book. This time, I am documenting what I read in short summaries as I read in the hopes that it will motivate me to keep going.
